My mods all fall under the MIT license. I'd appreciate the courtesy of dropping me a message when you include it in a mod pack. Do not upload standalone translated versions on Steam. If you wish to translate it, please give me a pull request on GitHub or drop me a line here.

If I don't respond/appear alive for a month after a new alpha release, have at it. However, give credit where it's due.
